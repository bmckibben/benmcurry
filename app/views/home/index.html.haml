          %p I am an aspiring author in the middle of the second draft of my first novel. During the day-time I work as an Internet Application Developer.
          %p As a child I lived in several different places. My father was in the US Army so we found ourselves in a new location every four years. I now reside in the United States. I am a world traveler and lived in Malaysia for ten years during my early adulthood.
          %p More than getting used to change as a child, I learned to embrace it. Change is an integral part of my psyche and because of that I embrace diversity in all its forms.
          %p I have a passion for Science Fiction. Details of my current work is available below.

          %p Paxxa was abducted by extraterrestrials as a toddler and taken to be raised in the culture of the Raquesti. Paxxa will return to earth as a emissary for the alien culture. Paxxaâ€™s mission is to teach Raquesti science to the people of earth in the hope of recreating knowledge the Raquesti lost in a devastating war.
          %p Greg Macsen is a former physics professor with a theory of hyper-dimensional energy.  A totalitarian regime has forced him to work in a secret weapons laboratory.  He has been broken by the sadistic head of national security who is using the memory of his ex-girlfriend to taunt him.
          %p Greg is rescued and meets Paxxa in the sanctuary of an underground resistance movement. Together they  create a device that can help the resistance battle the corrupt government. What will happen when the government tries to thwart their plans?
