## Rails 7 with hotwire Turbo, Jquery, and Bootstrap

- This application starts with Gorails tutorial [How to use jQuery & jQueryUI with Esbuild[(https://gorails.com/episodes/how-to-use-jquery-with-esbuild)

- Once the base site is created, I continue building with [Turbo Rails Tutorial](https://www.hotrails.dev/turbo-rails)

- Instead of using the Turbo Rails Tutorial Quote model, I am using my own Wiki model and recreating a wiki app I had previously created in Rails 5.
